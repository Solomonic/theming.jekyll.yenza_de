[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) is an [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) process or a way of organizing teamwork to increase productivity, quality and to react _agile_ on changing requirements. Scrum usually utilizes daily 15min stand-up meetings where all team members tell the rest of the team what 1) they have done yesterday 2) what they are they going to do today 3) Are problems in sight? [The agile principles](http://www.agilemanifesto.org 'Read the agile manifesto ...') where often presented as the only right approach for any project, but my professional experience does not support this as truth and neither so for many of my colleague as [the excellent article](http://opensource.com/business/15/11/open-development-method 'Read full article: Scrum is dead: breaking down the new open development method ') of [Ahmad Nassri](http://opensource.com/users/ahmadnassri) shows.

Our setup will rather consider decentralized team-members working asynchron from different locations and timezones, then a well organized team in a shared office. So Scrum is not really fitting, but anyway are some of its tools very useful for supporting global teamwork as the [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban 'read about Kanban on wikipedia ....') boards on [trello.com](http://trello.com 'Work together on task lists ...') for coordinating tasks and organizing projects of any size. A classic Kanban board actually contains three lists, one for open tasks-to-do, one for tasks the team is working on right now and one for the finished tasks. Team members update these lists by moving sheets/cards describing the tasks between the lists, indicating the status of the work. This visualisation helps a lot to see whats going on in a team, shortens communication lines and enables team-leaders to balance work load and identify problems early. The [free online tool](http://trello.com 'Work together on task lists ...') offers [a lot useful features](https://trello.com/tour) as real-time notification, filters, time-lines, access-management and unlimited team members cooperating on one board for one goal. Nevertheless is it well received by people with little technical understanding because ... it is fun to use and implements a good UX strategy.
