      There are many misconceptions about Rastafari. For many Rastafari means chilling at the beach, 
      wearing dreadlocks, smoking weed, listen to Reggae music and having a relaxed time. Even though these
      things are enjoyable, they are by no means what this is about and many Rastaman and Rastawoman don't
      participate in some or all of them while being no less Rasta.
    - >-
      An other typical understanding is that Rasta is only for black people and that anyone with the wrong amount of melanin
      or origin is guilty of cultural appropriation, stealing from black culture for the very own benefit. I am
      a causasian male and I am a Rastaman, so naturally I reject those claims for the depth of my heart. One may disagree
      but if you are interested in this topic and have the patience to read my points of view gathered over my entire adult life, 
      you may decide by yourself and come to your very own conclusions.

      I reasoned with Rasta Elders and many people from all corners of the world what Rasta actually means to them and what it is.
      This topic is not undisputed at all and we'll have a look at the counterpoints a little later but the majority
      agrees that Rastafari is NOT a religion but a sense of spirituality within yourself, a mindset or philosophy which teaches
      us right from wrong, how to be an upright and valuable member of the community and a way of inner growing to be a better self.
    - >-
      Rasta is about reclaiming the balance between the inner spiritual and the outer world, between nature and economics, escaping
      mental oppression and going beyond racism, sexism and all manners of devision. It is about human relations and respect
      for all beings. The core message is summarised beautifully with: **One Love, one Heart, one Aim, one Destiny**

      After all, we are born equal, we share the same space and time and just have this Life to spend. If we work together,
      pay respect to one another and don't let greed fuck-up the world for everyone, we are all together in a way better place
      and can give the following generations a future which is worth living in.
    - >-
      Rasta teaches us to avoid detrimental influences, to surround ourself with positivity and people who uplift instead
      of trying to bring you down. It teaches us to care for the elderly, the youth, the meak and the poor. It teaches to respect our
      parents who went through a lot of pain and suffering to bring us into this life and put food on the table. Even though we are
      all flawed beings, we all deserve respect and love as long as we try to be good and upright.

      After all that you may assume that all Rastas are supposed to be pacifists, but that is not true. Evil beings who
      cheat, steal, murders, rape or molest will not be tolerated by the Rastas. We are Warriors and come after them in anger and chase them
      out of our communities. Those individuals just working for their own benefits and greed won't get any love until they change
      their ways. Every human being make mistakes but if you go through a spiritual re-birth and honestly change to follow the
      righteous path, then Rasta will not judge you for what has been but for what you are right now.

      All those priciples do NOT require a religious belief of any form. In my understanding it is common sense and not bound to dogma,
      organizations or institutions to represent the special interest of Rastafari. You can be Christian, Moslem, Hindu, Buddhist, Jew 
      or Atheist and be Rasta. Your religion is usually determinated by your place of birth, upbringing and social environment, all factors
      you have very little influence. Rasta on the other hand is all about the things you choose to do and in which direction
      you steer your life, so being born in the "wrong" place with the "wrong" religion can't disqualify you as long as you do the right things.

      It is a undeniable fact that the Rastafari movement was born out of a religious background, even though I don't subscribe to it.
      There are plenty of religious Rastas on the very foundation of Rasta who pratice their beliefe in regards to God and an eternal life. 
      I'm not a brother to judge anyone on their background or on what they hold true in their hearts and souls nor would I ridicule that in
      any way. As a matter of fact there are many great Rasta who feel very passionate about the divinty of Haile Selassie I and the evil deeds 
      of the devil. Since I can't really talk about that please feel free to do your own research when it comes to the 
      [religious aspects of Rastafari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari).

      These aspects od Rastafari are topic I simply don't feel I have a qualified opinion about as a causasian man. I understand it as a way to
      uplift the consciousness by rediscovering the identity and culture of black people which face systemic racism on a daily basis.
    - >-
      I don't share the same experiences and I don't understand the struggle but I know it is real, holding human beings down and prevent them
      from many opportunities. Racism is Cancer for society and until we as a human race overcome it permanently, there will be no justice and 
      equal rights for everyone.

      “Today, we look to the future calmly, confidently, and courageously. We look to the vision of an Africa not merely free but united. In facing this new challenge, 
      we can take comfort and encouragement from the lessons of the past. We know that there are differences among us. Africans enjoy different cultures, distinctive values, 
      special attributes. But we also know that unity can be and has been attained among men of the most disparate origins, that differences of race, of religion, of culture, 
      of tradition, are no insuperable obstacle to the coming together of peoples. History teaches us that unity is strength.”

  text:
    - >-
      The name of the Rastafari movement is a direct reference to Haile Selassie I. Born as Lij Tafari Makonnen later as Governor of Harar known as **Ras Tafari** Makonnen. 
      While **Ras** literially translates to "head" it is a rank of nobility in the Ethopian society often translated as "Prince". His given name **Tafari** means "one who is respected or feared" 
      and is followed by that of his father **Makonnen**. A common Rasta interpretaion of the name is "the respected head/prince who's feared by his opponents"
    - >-
      If you call yourself Rastafari, you have to respect Haile Selassie I as the spiritual leader, teacher and wise man, as your King who governs your path through life. 
      Whilst Rasta is mostly free of dogma or specific rules I beliefe that you have to love and study **H**is **I**mperial **M**ajesty and absorb and internalize his teachings.
      Without this premise you can be a righteous and valuable being without a doubt, but you should not take on his name.
    - >-
      The wise words of his majesty, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah are inspiring and can help us to see the light when darkness is all around us.
- quote:
    >-
      “That until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned; 
      That until there are no longer first-class and second-class citizens of any nation; That until the color of a man’s skin is of no more 
      significance than the color of his eyes; That until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all without regard to race; 
      That until that day, the dream of lasting peace and world citizenship and the rule of international morality will remain but a fleeting illusion, 
      to be pursued but never attained”.

- quote:

      “Education is a means of sharpening the mind of man both spiritually and intellectually. 
      It is a two-edged sword that can be used either for the progress of mankind or for its destruction. 
      That is why it has been Our constant desire and endeavor to develop our education for the benefit of mankind”.
- quote:
    >-
      “Leadership does not mean domination. The world is always well supplied with people who wish to rule and dominate 
      others. The true leader is a different sort; he seeks effective activity which has a truly beneficient purpose. 
      He inspires others to follow in his wake, and holding aloft the torch of wisdom, leads the way for society to realize 
      its genuinely great aspirations”
