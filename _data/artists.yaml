    Jacob Miller is without a doubt one of the most iconic Reggae artists of all
    times. He was the lead singer of "Inner Circle" and stared in the brilliant
    movie "Rockers" alongside many other musicians including Gregory Isaacs, Big
    Youth and Burning Spear.

      He was born on 4 May 1952 in Mandeville, Jamaica and died way too early on
      23 March 1980 in a tragic car accident on Hope road in Kingston, Jamaica,
      just reaching 27 years of age. Until today goes his Christmas Album on
      heavy rotation during the season in Jamaica and through his work and
      personality he left a big impression on the genre and influenced countless
      artists coming after him.

      Jacob "Killer" Miller worked in the late 60s and early 70s with Clement
      "Sir Coxsone" Dodd, Augustus Pablo and his songs "False Rasta", "Who Say
      Jah No Dread" and "Each One Teach One" became classics with King Tubby
      dubs on their B-sides.

      In 1974 he became the permanent vocalist of "Inner Circle" and created
      unforgetable hits as "Tenement Yard" and "I'm a Rastaman". At his peak
      only Bob Marley was more popular in Jamaica than Miller, and as a live act
      nobody equaled their popularity.

      Shortly before his death in 1980, after recording his last album "Mixed Up
      Moods", he was preparing for an American tour with Bob Marley and the
      Wailers, which died just little more then one year later.
